# 🐸 Eat That Frog – iOS Productivity App

[Click me to visit the website!](https://eatthatfrog.carrd.co) - **Made a quick website for users of the app.**

After seeing my screen time hit 8+ hours a day, I built **Eat That Frog** as a fun and effective way to break stop doomscrolling.  
Inspired by Brian Tracy’s **Eat That Frog** method, the app helps users tackle their most important task first, while blending **behavioral design, habit-building, and playful micro-interactions**.
